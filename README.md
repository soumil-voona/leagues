## 🎯 Inspiration

We’ve noticed that people our age are getting less physical activity. Technological entertainment is replacing the time usually spent on physical activity. This lack of movement can lead to serious health problems in the future. To fix this, we created **Leagues**.

## 💡 What It Does

**Leagues** is a digital platform that encourages physical activity by enabling friendly matchmaking for sports teams. It prioritizes **fun over competition**, transforming sports into a tool for **social bonding and wellness**. Our skill-based matchmaking system ensures fair games, regardless of experience.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Material UI (MUI)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore + Authentication)
- **Auth**: Google Login via OAuth 2.0
- **Communication**: Git (code collaboration), WhatsApp (team coordination)
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

- Communication issues due to time zones and poor internet (some teammates were on vacation).
- Debugging Firebase integration and UI responsiveness.
- Managing teamwork with varied experience levels and schedules.

## 🏆 Accomplishments We're Proud Of

## 📚 What We Learned

- How to scale projects according to our skillsets.
- More in-depth experience with **React**, **Firebase**, and **OAuth**.

## 🚀 What's Next for Leagues
